-Circles on the left side have a tendency to get placed on the right
-Cannot place circle in between two other circles
-When circle lands to the right of where aiming at, and keep firing aiming at the same spot will 
    keep going in the same spot and replacing the circle that is already there
-Fix circles not getting placed on the correct spot
-Circles moving down system:
    >Start with 6 "lives"
    >Causing any number of circles to get removed does not remove a "life"
    >When a circle is placed that does not remove any circles, a "life" is removed
    >If "lifes" gets to 0, then move all circles down and reset "lifes"
-Place launcher below where the last row of game is (aimer can go above thought)
-Lose game if a circle reaches bottom
-Score, with more points better with more circles removed (meaning that removing 
    5 circles with one circle is more points that removing 1 circle with one circle 
    five times)
-Fancy animations:
    >Launched circle impact (different than removing )
    >Remove circles animation
    >Move circles down animation
