BUGS
-Sometimes launched circle will go through a circle
-Sometimes launched circle will end up in the wrong spot
-Left and right edge islands are never removed
-Sometimes islands are not removed

TODO
-Circles moving down system:
    >Start with 6 "lives"
    >Causing any number of circles to get removed does not remove a "life"
    >When a circle is placed that does not remove any circles, a "life" is removed
    >If "lifes" gets to 0, then move all circles down and reset "lifes"
-Place launcher below where the last row of game is (aimer can go above thought)
-Lose game if a circle reaches bottom
-Score, with more points better with more circles removed (meaning that removing 
    5 circles with one circle is more points that removing 1 circle with one circle 
    five times)
-When entire board is cleared game is won
-Make circles look better
-Fancy animations:
    >Launched circle impact (different than removing )
    >Remove circles animation
    >Move circles down animation
    >Something for game over
    >Something for game won
